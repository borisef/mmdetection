## Intro 

Congratulations! You are about to develop mmdetection code. We want this code to be useful and maintainable. 
We also want to be able to keep this code up-to-date with the web version. So we all will need to stick to some basic guidelines to achieve this. 


## Git Guidelines

#### Remote repositories
Our repository for mmdetection code is XXX. First of all you suppose to `fork` it. Let's suppose your fork is XXX

Let's list all the remote repositories your git knows:

``````
git remote -v
``````

You suppose to see something like: 

``````
origin XXX
39484 XXX

``````
If you don't see, use `git remote add`  and `git remote remove` commands to map nicknames of remote repositories

#### Branches


#### Merge request


## Code Guidelines

We have three types of code in this project: 
1) Legacy code: original mmdetection code from web 
2) Group code: code developed by us and used by 2 or more projects 
3) Private/experimental code: code developed by us and used by 1 project or under experiment
